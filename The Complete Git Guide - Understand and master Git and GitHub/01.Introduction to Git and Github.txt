SECTION - 1


Git is a distributed version control system.
It is called a distributed version control system because 
in this we can work with multiple people on the same project.


Git can track changes in files in any folder called repository.

Under the hood, Git has its own "file strcuture" 
and every file is stored in a specific document 
and every file has a specific(unique) hash.

Git is simply persistent hash map that stores key-value pairs.

Key is hash of the file and value is content of the file.

Git could be used locally without internet and locally.
This provides us with the full access to the files change history.

Git stores all the data locally in the computer.

Github maybe used just as a backuop for all the local git repositories.

Github is primarily used by distributed teams that work on
the same projects.

Git is a special file system that allows you to store changes in the computer.
