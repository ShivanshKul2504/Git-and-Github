SECTION - 9

GIT PUSH , FETCH AND PULL 


Git push 

- > Push to remote repository only fully tested and verified features.



Git fetch 

    Lets suppose that new branch was created in the remote repository.
    After "git fetch" same branch will be created in your local git repository because branch is just text file in the .git/refs/heads.




Git pull 

- > 

- > Git pull consists of git fetch and git merge

Example of pull : 
1. clone remote repo
2. checkout 'master' branch locally
3. Make changes and commit them in "master" branch in remotre repository.
4. After "git pull " locally git will fetch remote changes.
5. After fetching git will merge remote "master" branch into local "master" branch (fast forward or 3-way merge)
6. Staging area (index) and working directory will be automatically updated after merge.



WHAT IS ORIGIN ? 

- > The default name of our repository is the 'origin'
- > By default all the operations are performed from the 'origin' repository.

git remote
    - > List all the remote servers for your local repositories with server.

-  > By default after cloning git will not create corresponding local for all remote branches except default remote branch.


LIST REMOTE AND LOCAL BRANCHES 

- > git branch - a 
    - > This command is used to list all the remote branches and local branches 

- > git branch -r 
    - > This command is used to list all the remote branches only.

- > git branch 
    - > This command is used to list all the local branches.


TRACKING BRANCH 

- > It is a local branch that is connected to the specific remote branch.

- > After cloning of any remote repository git will create only one local branch with the same name as default branch in the remote repository.

git branch -vv 
    - > This command is used to see all the remote braches and local branches and will tell which branch is the tracking branch.


CHECKOUT REMOTE BRANCH 

??? 



Git remote show origin 

- > git remote show origin 
    - > Fetch url, Push url, Head, remote , local, local refs will be shown after running this command.


Pruning, Pruning a Branch ?



GIT PULL IS A 2 STEP PROCESS 

- > It merges remote branch into current branch.

Step - 1 : git fetches all the updates into our repository.
Step - 2 : git merge FETCH_HEAD 


- > After fetching local it merges remote brnach into local tracking branch using either fast forward merge or 3 - Way merge

- > Git pull updates only single local currently checked out branch.


HOW TO PERFORM GIT PULL 

1. Checkout local branch and make sure it is tracking brnach and has corresponding remote branch.
    Use git branch -vv for check
2. Enter git pull 
3. Git will fetch all changes from remote repository - git fetch is executed in background.
4. After fetching git updates FETCH_HEAD file that contains SHA1 hashes of last commits in remote repository for all tracking branches .
5. Git merges remote branch into current branch git merge FETCH_HEAD.


WHAT IS FETCH_HEAD  ?

- > ??????????

During Git pull git will first execute "git fetch" 
After fetching it will update .git/FETCH_HEAD list and first branch in this list will be currently checked out branch.

Finally git executes "git merge FETCH_HEAD" command that finds first brnahc in .git/FETCH_HEAD list without "not-for-merge" tag and merges it into local tracking currenlty checked out branch.


GIT PULL WITH FAST FORWARD MERGE EXAMPLE : 


??????????????????????????????????



FETCH REMOTE CHANGES MANUALLY ??????????


MERGE FETCH HEAD MANUALLY


CREATE REMOTE BRANCH BASED ON LOCAL BRANCH


HOW TO UPDATE TRACKING STATUSES ON 



git show-ref
