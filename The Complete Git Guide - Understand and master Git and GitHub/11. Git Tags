SECTION - 11 

GIT TAGS 

- > Git tag is the static text pointer to a specific commit.

- > Tags can be created in any project at any point of time.

- > Git tags are used to add release versions of a project.




STAGING VS PRODUCTION 

The work here happens on the basis of CI/CD Continuos Integration and Development.


STAGING 

- primarily for testing
- Usually for internal use
- Merging is performed frequently 
- Different feature branches are merged into release branch
- Multiple people ma have merge rights


PRODUCTION 

- for stable production service
- for customers
- merging happens each 2 weeks or 1 month
- Usually only release branch is merged into master branches
- only few people have merge rights 



SEMANTIC VERSIONING 

- > It is the common approach to number every release of a software.

v5.1.3

- > 5 is major version, 1 is minor version, 3 is patch version.

- > It is highly not recommended to automatically install major updates of the packages you software depends on.


WHY USE SEMANTIC VERSIONING ?



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIGHTWEIGHT AND ANNOATED TAGS

Lighweight 

- git tag v1.0.0
- it is stored in the .git/refs/tags 


Annotated 

- git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "New tag"
- It is stored in the .git/refs/tags
- It is also stored in the .git/objects 
- Stores tag message 
- Stores tag author and date 


- > It is recommended to use Annotated tags instead of lightweight tags.

- > Tag names must be unique around the whole repository.


CREATING LIGHTWEIGHT TAGS

 git tag v1.0.0

????????????????????????????

- > git tag 
    - > It is used to see all the tags in the repository.

        git tag v1.0.0
        git show v1.0.9

- > Git tags are not pushed to remote with "git push" command.



- > git tag v1.0.0 -m "New tag" is used to create a new annotated tag

PUSHING TAGS TO REMOTE 

git push --tags
    - > This command is used to push the tags into the repository.
    git push -v --tags 


To push only a single to the repository : 
    git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Patch for v1.0.0"

    git push -v v1.0.1 
    - > This tag will be successfully pushed to the server.

- > When we are pushing tags, commits are not pushed. We need to user 'git push' to push commits to remote.
