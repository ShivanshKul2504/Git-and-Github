SECTION - 6

CLONING A PUBLIC REPOSITORY


- > If you choose download option at hithub, you will download only contents of the working directory.
- > Git repository(hidden .git folder) will not be downloaded in such case.

git clone <url-string>
- > With this the public repository will be downloaded with all the commits intact and different versions of the project we can checkout.


- > Git stores all the objects in the pack file,it is archived to save space.
- > The extensions of the file in the pack folder are .idx and .pack 

Action plan for unpacking .pack file : 
1. Move .pack file out of the "pack" folder
2. Use "git unpack-objects" command.

cat pack-sha1hash \ git unpack-objects 


GIT DIFF COMMAND 
- > git diff command is used to see the changes in the file now than before.

git diff 
diff --git a/Git-and-Github b/Git-and-Github
index 23c8b49..1f8f882 160000
--- a/Git-and-Github
+++ b/Git-and-Github

- > with 'a\' we see the previous file.
- > with 'b\' we see the the new file in which changes are made.
- > with index we see the hash of both the files listed.


- > We can move commits from the new-feature branch to the master branch by using the git branch merge feature.
