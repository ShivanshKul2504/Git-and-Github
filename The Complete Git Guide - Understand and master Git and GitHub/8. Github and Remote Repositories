- > git clone <git-clone-url>
    This is used to clone the repository.


WHAT IS REMOTE REPOSITORY

- > Remote repository is the same as the local repository in terms of structure.
- > Remote repository does not get updated automatically , if we make changes in the local repository.


- > Git GUI applications like github dekstop, sourcetree or vscode may fetch updates from the remote repository in background but you need to pull them manually.
