SECTION - 9

GIT PUSH , FETCH AND PULL 


Git push 

- > Push to remote repository only fully tested and verified features.



Git fetch 

    Lets suppose that new branch was created in the remote repository.
    After "git fetch" same branch will be created in your local git repository because branch is just text file in the .git/refs/heads.




Git pull 

- > 

Example of pull : 
1. clone remote repo
2. checkout 'master' branch locally
3. Make changes and commit them in "master" branch in remotre repository.
4. After "git pull " locally git will fetch remote changes.
5. After fetching git will merge remote "master" branch into local "master" branch (fast forward or 3-way merge)
6. Staging area (index) and working directory will be automatically updated after merge.



WHAT IS ORIGIN ? 

- > The default name of our repository is the 'origin'
- > By default all the operations are performed from the 'origin' repository.

git remote
    - > List all the remote servers for your local repositories with server.

-  > By default after cloning git will not create corresponding local for all remote branches except default remote branch.


LIST REMOTE AND LOCAL BRANCHES 

- > git branch - a 
    - > This command is used to list all the remote branches and local branches 

- > git branch -r 
    - > This command is used to list all the remote branches only.

- > git branch 
    - > This command is used to list all the local branches.


TRACKING BRANCH 

- > It is a local branch that is connected to the specific remote branch.

- > After cloning of any remote repository git will create only one local branch with the same name as default branch in the remote repository.

git branch -vv 
    - > This command is used to see all the remote braches and local branches and will tell which branch is the tracking branch.


CHECKOUT REMOTE BRANCH 

??? 



Git remote show origin 

- > git remote show origin 
    - > Fetch url, Push url, Head, remote , local, local refs will be shown after running this command.
